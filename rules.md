# Rules of Uno

* 2 players minimum, 10 players maximum
* Cards can be red, green, blue, yellow, or match-all-colors
* The deck is composed of 108 cards, in which:
  * cards from 1 to 9 are eight in total for each number:
    2 reds, 2 greens, 2 blues, and 2 yellows (72 in total)
  * cards 0 are four in total, each of a different color (4 in total)
  * skip, +2, and flip-direction cards are also two of each color (24 in total)
  * change-color and +4 cards
    * are four cards of each (8 in total)
    * can be stacked onto any card
    * can change the color to any other
  * +2 and +4 cards require that the next player in the queue draws
    2 and 4 cards from the deck, respectively
  * skip, +2, and +4 force the next player in the queue to skip their
    turn
    * the invert-direction card has the same effect as the skip card
      when only 2 players are playing.
* Each player starts with 7 cards
* When the deck is depleted, all cards on the stack minus the topmost
  one are reshuffled into a new deck
